I am a B.S. Mechanical Engineering student at Rice University with a focus on aerospace engineering and a passive interest in math. I am a proud member of Rice Eclipse, Rice's student rocketry team, as a Propulsion team member and Ground Systems subteam lead. I am also a member of Rice's Student Association as the Senator from Hanszen College. I live in Spencer, Iowa.
